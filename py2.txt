1. Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:
   If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
   If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “Python Training” as a string
   If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd - Python       Training” as astring.

Ans. 

i = int(input("Enter the number :"  ))
if i %3==0 and i %5==0:
    print("Consultadd - Python Training")
elif i %3==0:
    print("Consultadd")
elif i %5==0:
    print("Python Training")
else:
    print("Not divisible by 3 or 5")

2. Write a program in Python to perform the following operator based task:
a) Ask user to choose the following option first:
      If User Enter 1 - Addition
      If User Enter 2 - Subtraction
      If User Enter 3 - Division
      If User Enter 4 - Multiplication
     If User Enter 5 - Average
b) Ask user to enter two numbers and keep those numbers in variables num1 and num2
   respectively for the first 4 options mentioned above.
c) Ask the user to enter two more numbers as first and second for calculating the       average as soon as the user chooses an option 5.
d) At the end if the answer of any operation is Negative print a statement saying    “NEGATIVE”
e) NOTE: At a time a user can only perform one action.

Ans.  

print("Enter 1 for addition, 2 for Substraction, 3 for division, 4 for multiplication, 5 for Average")
i = (int(input("Enter your choice:    ")))
if i >5:
    print("Wrong Choice")
else:
    num1 = int(input("Enter 1st number:   "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter 2nd number:   "))
    add = num1 + num2
    sub = num1 - num2
    mul = num1 * num2
    div = num1 / num2
    if i == 1:
        print("The result is :  ", add)
    elif i == 2:
        print("The result is :  ", sub)
    elif i == 3:
        print("The result is :  ", div)
    elif i == 4:
        print("The result is :  ", mul)
    elif i == 5:
        num3 = int(input("Enter 3rd number :   "))
        num4 = int(input("Enter 4th number :   "))
        print("The result is :  ", (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4) / int(4))
    else:
        print("Wrong input")
